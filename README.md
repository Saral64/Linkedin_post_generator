## **Overview**  
Imagine Saral, a LinkedIn influencer, who wants to maintain consistency in his posts but struggles with ideas or phrasing. This tool takes his previous posts, extracts essential elements like topics, tone, and structure, and then generates fresh posts that align with his style.  

Users can customize parameters such as **topic, length, and language**, and with a click of the **"Generate"** button, they get a new post that mirrors their past writing approach.

## **How it Works?**

1. **Phase 1:** Scrape and analyze LinkedIn posts, identifying key features such as topic, language, and length.  
2. **Phase 2:** Leverage these extracted features to generate a new post. The system applies few-shot learning, using relevant past posts to guide the LLM in replicating the influencer's unique style.

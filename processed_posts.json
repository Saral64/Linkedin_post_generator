        "text": "I recently had an insightful conversation with my mentors at work, one that left me reflecting deeply.\n\nThe discussion revolved around where I could add the most value given my experience, learnings, and aspirations. That\u2019s when they turned to me and said, \u201cYou need to start thinking like an entrepreneur, not just a leader.\u201d For a moment, I paused, letting the weight of those words sink in.\n\nAll my life, I\u2019ve been told to strive to be a leader, not a manager. And now, here I was, hearing something entirely different\u2014be an entrepreneur, not just a leader. The shift in perspective was subtle yet profound.\n\nWhen you align yourself deeply with business goals, leadership tends to emerge naturally. But when you begin to see yourself not just as a contributor but as a cornerstone of the business, everything changes. Titles, structures, and teams become secondary. You start to operate like a business owner\u2014invested, unafraid, and ready to tackle challenges head-on, without being tethered to past achievements or the comforts of legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s about embodying the mindset of a founder\u2014absorbing their relentless drive, their expansive vision, their ability to build, rebuild, and move forward without attachment. It\u2019s not about basking in what you\u2019ve already created, nor about claiming the fruits of your past efforts. It\u2019s about embracing the uncertainty of starting from scratch over and over again, giving it everything you have, and then letting go to move on to the next challenge.\n\nThis mindset is not for the faint-hearted. It demands resilience, a willingness to embrace discomfort, and an insatiable curiosity to explore uncharted paths. Yet, it\u2019s enriching in ways that few other journeys can be. It transforms not just what you do, but who you are.\n\nAnd perhaps that\u2019s the ultimate growth\u2014to think beyond roles and titles and to step into the shoes of an entrepreneur, ready to shape the future.\n\n#womenintech #problemsolver #lambdatest\n\nAsad Khan Jay Singh Maneesh Sharma",

        "text": "Why Representation in Leadership Matters!\n\nThis is one topic which everyone talks about but few actually put in the effort for it. Why is that? It takes hard work, empathy, time, a secured peer, and a true leader to support and ensure women representation in management.\n\nI often get feedback that managers shy away from hiring female resources, especially in sales, as they find it difficult to work with them under pressure and deliver desired outcomes.\n\nMy only advice to one and all is to prioritize your career in the early years and surround yourself with the right friends, managers, and leaders. Else, the road to success is already hard, but it will be the hardest.\n\nIn my early career, I often felt pressured to fit into the \u2018bro culture\u2019 of male-dominated leadership. I often found myself being the only woman in a room full of male leaders. It\u2019s hard to admit, but I used to emulate male leaders, trying to fit in and not end up losing equal opportunities. I\u2019m sharing this because I know I am not the only one. This is why representation matters, especially in tech and sales.\n\nI found success when I decided to be my true self\u2014vulnerable, honest, empathetic. It was a hard transition, but worth it. This is still a work in progress for me, and I owe much to my husband, mentor, and peers who have supported me. I\u2019m learning every day to be more successful and less exhausted.\n\nThis is why diverse representation in leadership is vital. When leaders reflect different backgrounds and experiences, no one feels they need to conform to outdated norms or feel the need to hide their true selves to succeed. Let\u2019s stop apologizing for who we are and create spaces where everyone can thrive authentically.\n\n#Leadership #Diversity #Authenticity #WomenInLeadership",

When should we truly look at AI to solve sales problems without sacrificing the essence of sales?\n\nThe key lies in quality over quantity. If you're prioritizing broad reach without any data-backed relevancy, you're veering into marketer territory, focusing on brand awareness. Sales, on the other hand, is about relationship building and funnel optimization.\n\nAI should enhance our ability to score signals, but the execution\u2014timing and quality conversations\u2014should be left to salespeople.\n\nSpraying prospects with constant outreach to come for a meeting will only increase lead burn rates. Effective sales leverage all channels efficiently, not just one. This is where managers and leaders play a critical and irreplaceable role. As we adopt more AI, their role in training and guiding reps becomes even more critical.\n\nLet\u2019s avoid the AI trap.

Every day, I\u2019m reminded that success is a team effort, fueled by the unwavering support of peers, bosses, and the incredible individuals I have the privilege to lead.\n\nBut Man! Does it get tough? Do I have bad days? Do I lose my shit when things are delayed and deadlines loom? Is it daunting to navigate diverse personalities? YES, one hundred percent! But what truly keeps me going -\n\n- Ability to listen and be proactive in conflict resolution. It\u2019s about hearing every voice and ensuring every concern is addressed with fairness and empathy. I have realised sometimes all it takes is lending an empathetic ear to resolve conflicts and reassure team members.\n\n- Passion and self-drive to leave a lasting legacy and encourage others to dream big! This keeps me going even on my toughest days.\n\n- Financial independence, nothing can beat this satisfaction.\n\n- Meeting new people and diving into uncharted territories keeps me energized literally every day.\n\n- Seeking help from peers, management, and team. Being vocal about needs, issues, and collective solutions ensures there is trust and transparency.\n\n- Being genuinely invested in an individual\u2019s growth even if it comes at your own expense. Going out of the way to make things happen for them - This is a non-negotiable for me.\n\nI am so consumed by work that there are times when I can\u2019t even recall who I am without it. I am sure many of you would relate with me :)\n\nCheers to embracing this journey and leaving a legacy worth celebrating!\n\n#sales #leadership #growthmindset",

I've learned firsthand the critical importance of ensuring that every member of your leadership team is not just qualified on paper, but truly the right fit for your organization's vision and values.\n\nOver my more than a decade-long career, I've seen companies with solid teams, strong cultures, and impressive products crumble because of one fatal flaw: hiring the wrong leaders. It's the difference between success and failure, between growth and stagnation.\n\nSo how do we solve this dilemma?\n\nDeep, confidential ref checks are paramount.\n\nAnyone who you are hiring can easily leave a good impression on you based on the ranks they have covered and experience that they carry, but how did they navigate tough situations? How did they handle cross-team conflicts? These insights can only come from different reference checks (direct boss, peer, reportee).\n\nAdditionally, I've found that taking the time for relaxed, informal meetings \u2013 perhaps over lunch or dinner \u2013 with potential hires can be incredibly revealing. It's in these settings that you can gauge not just their professional skills, but their character, their values, and their fit with your company.\n\nIf your confidence is growing after each meeting, then trust your instinct and bring them on board. However, if your confidence is shrinking meeting after meeting, then you just dodged a potential disaster.\n\n#Leadership #ReferenceChecks #SalesSuccess #Hiring",

I have often seen and heard stories about how companies discuss their culture during interviews, emphasizing its importance but then delegating its execution to ONE team.\n\nNow let me tell you what most of us have experienced at LambdaTest. Here, we are all involved in execution! It is so top-down that you just cannot ignore it. And it changes the whole game.\n\nEveryone is motivated and knows what they are doing, and what impact it creates on the business and our customers. This is so endearing that you want to wake up, dress up, show up at work, and give your best every single time!\n\nWe talk openly about issues, resolutions, what\u2019s working, and what\u2019s not working. There is no place for delusion.\nI personally hate deluded people. That\u2019s not my cup of tea.\n\nI sometimes get feedback that we are stringent with our hiring. Yes, we are strict with our hiring and hold people accountable, but that\u2019s how you disrupt the market and build a top-notch company within a few years against all odds in a highly competitive market.\n\nWe are an execution-focused company. Yes, we keep everyone from founders to leaders to ICs on their toes and don\u2019t settle for mediocrity.\n\nOn that note, we have organized an in-person event with our leaders and top industry speakers to share their learnings about how you can impact your and your team\u2019s productivity with new-age methods, solving traditional problems with the latest tech and approach.\n\nA great opportunity to learn and grow together! Sometimes, one day can change your life and for some of you, this could be that day!\nSave the date - 9th May 2024 (Virtual)\n\nChandni Chopra Asad Khan Jay Singh Maneesh Sharma\n\n#sales #aiinsales #demandgeneration #career #thoughtleadership #outbound #inbound #accountmanagement #customersuccess #culture #events",

I'm thrilled to play a part in advancing our global presence even further by solving tough testing problems for Quality Engineering teams. Here's a look at the factors that have led me to where I am today.\n\n- Nothing in this world is so important for you to take so much pressure and mess up your mental peace. I stay calm and this allows me to be able to think clearly and take actions.\n\n- Leadership navigation is a SKILL. It comes with experience. No one in the WORLD can teach you that. What really helps is finding the right mentor. Actually, they find you ;) A right mentor is someone who has an influence to make you ascend the success ladder. Rest, what you seek from your friends, family, and others is advice. Do not confuse between the two. Mentorship takes effort and time. You can even take up their job but mentors are never insecure. They nurture you instead. Leaders BUILD Leaders.\n\n- I killed my EGO long time ago. The only leadership that is indisposable is the one which has a buy-in from the team, can help unblock them swiftly.\n\n- I am a highly ambitious, tenacious and self driven person and I work my ass off to do my job with 100% sincerity and focus. I always tell my team - have guts to find your glory. Have a purpose in life and then do everything possible to make that distant dream turn into reality. Sky is the limit!\n\nOne thing that has worked like magic for me is the ability to take feedback and work actively on fixing gaps. Other thing is to have faith in myself and be the best version of myself each and every day.\n\nPS - This is straight from my heart. I wish to see more and more women in leadership. I will do my bit and continue sharing my experiences. We definitely don\u2019t get it easy but that\u2019s a story for some other day :)\n\n#lambdatestyourapps #womenintech #leadership #techsales #b2bsales #demandgen #saas",

Rather, the entire post-sales cycle is responsible for it.\n\nI have often seen companies attributing Customer Success job to JUST product adoption metric. However, the role of a CS person is not just that. It goes much beyond this only metric. \n\nA client invests in your product not to just use your product but to solve their pain point and your product happens to be just one piece of the solution. And in some cases, the switching cost is low, and for others it's high. Hence, the role of a CS person requires having a holistic understanding of the business, what outcomes the client is expecting, what exactly will move the needle, and then put together these pieces to ensure how positively it will impact their KRAs.\n\nBelieve me, this is what will give you an opportunity to have leadership buy-in and that\u2019s what will make you irreplaceable. So, it's not your product but how well you understand their business objectives and align it with the outcomes of using your platform.\n\n#customersuccess #strategy #retentionstrategy #growth",

Nevertheless, I called again, different agent (B) attended my call, listened carefully, and then asked me to wait and transferred my call to another agent (C) who proceeded to ask me the same questions again. He then suggested to allow him 24 hours. It went on and on for a few days where I had to start all over again from scratch. Now imagine this in SaaS where someone chose you over others.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes that we make is not to have an effective and clearly laid out process for sales handover. The process of handing over the relationship with your customers from one part of the sales team to the next is a vulnerable point of transition similar to what we experience in a relay race with no finish line. If not done right, we can (and often do) completely drop the ball and set the relationship with the customer up for massive failure right out of the gate.\n\nIn a highly competitive space, the companies that can foster and nurture more of these relationships than their competitors will always have high retention fuel the growth. #sales #customersuccess #handover",

First, MARRY the problem, and understand it fully before jumping on solutions\n\n2) Manage your time effectively and stay on top of things. Always go prepared before your meeting and ensure you share meeting minutes\n\n3) Do not expect appreciation and a pat on your back as often as you are used to while working with managers.

Don't wait to hit a certain million milestone\n\n2) Have your CS leader report into the CEO instead of Sales head. Otherwise, the focus ends up being on revenue instead of pushing the customer to the next step in their customer journey.\n\n3) Incentivize CS function based on clearly defined key responsibilities - Retention and Expansion - to drive razor sharp focus\n\n4) Have clear rules of engagement. Clearly lay out who is responsible and accountable in different scenarios.\n\n5) Make time to listen to your customers everyday. Talk to at least 2-3 customers. Listen in to calls on Gong or Clari Copilot. Share learnings and discuss with your team every week.\n\n6) As companies grow, positioning changes as the target audience evolves. Every time this change is made, a gap is seen on the ground. Spend time updating playbooks, communicating changes thoroughly and providing feedback on calls. A mere email on the changes is not enough.\n\nThe above things will ensure your new business bias is in check.

Ensure you stay focused on your core job\n\n3) Consciously give it time and let things unfold at their own pace. Hold your horses\n\n4) Get clarity, focus on the bigger picture, and align yourself and your team with one objective\u2014company\u2019s growth. Nothing else! This must always be the focus.\n\nChange is constant and that\u2019s how it should be. The idea is to keep growing and learning with a positive attitude and a healthy life.\n\nLet me know your thoughts or learnings!\n\n#leadership #growthmindset #passionatepeople #changemanagement",
